The instructions for installing Geeklog are back in the docs directory.

Please refer to docs/index.html and docs/install.html for details.

While the installation instructions are up to date, some of the other
information contained in the docs directory may not. Better documentation
is being worked on. If you can offer help here, this would be very much
appreciated. Please write to the geeklog-devel mailing list if you want
to help on this. Thank you.
